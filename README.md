The key features are:

- **Fast to code**: Veloxide increases the speed of development by being simple, flexible and easy to use. Rust naturally [shifts bugs left](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shift-left_testing) to the compiler, so less time is spent debugging code, and more time is spent delivering value.
- **Fewer bugs**: All components of Veloxide are written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org), which is known for its safety and reliability [[1]](https://www.infoq.com/news/2021/04/rust-linux-kernel-development/) [[2]](https://security.googleblog.com/2023/01/supporting-use-of-rust-in-chromium.html) [[3]](https://security.googleblog.com/2022/12/memory-safe-languages-in-android-13.html)
- **Highly Performant**: Veloxide is built on top of the [Tokio](https://tokio.rs) async runtime and [Axum framework](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum), which leverage the power of Rust's [async/await syntax](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/expressions/await-expr.html) and [zero-cost abstractions](https://doc.rust-lang.org/beta/embedded-book/static-guarantees/zero-cost-abstractions.html) to give blazingly fast bare-metal performance.
- **Cloud Native**: Veloxide comes pre-configured with [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) for distributed tracing and a /metrics endpoint preconfigured for collection from [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/).
- **Standards-based**: Veloxide leverages the open standards for APIs: [OpenAPI](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification), [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/specification.html) and [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/). You choose how you want your API to be consumed.

## Design Patterns

Veloxide implements the following design patterns to support maintainability and flexibility:

- **[CQRS](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/cqrs)**: Veloxide uses Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) to help simplify and optimize the design by separating the read (view) and write (command) models.
- **[Event Sourcing](https://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html)**: Veloxide uses Event Sourcing to persist domain events to the database. Event sourcing is used to tie the read and write models together, as well as providing a complete and accurate audit trail of changes made to a system, which can be useful for debugging, compliance, and various other purposes.
- **[Layered Architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multitier_architecture)**: The codebase is divided into layers, each with a specific responsibility, as per the principles of [Domain-Driven Design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design). This makes the application easier to understand and maintain.

Further documentation on the design and implementation of Veloxide be found in the [/docs folder](https://github.com/liamwh/veloxide/tree/main/docs).

### Supporting containers

Veloxide comes pre-configured with the following supporting containers found in the `docker-compose.yml` file:

- **[Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io)**: Traces will be sent to Jaeger, which can be accessed at `http://localhost:16686`.
- **[Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/)** will be available at `http://localhost:9090`.
- **[Grafana](https://grafana.com/)**: Will be available at `http://localhost:3000`. The default username and password are both `admin`. Prometheus is already configured as the default data source.
- **[Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/)** will be be listening on port `5432` for new connections. The connection string is loaded from the environment variable `DATABASE_URL`, which is pre-configured in the .env file.
- **[Envoy](https://www.envoyproxy.io/)**: Coming soon.
- **[Open Policy Agent](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/)**: Coming soon.

Note that using the supporting containers is optional if you change the veloxide-config.yaml to use the memory database instead of postgres.

## Getting started

Install the pre-requisites:

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

Install the Veloxide CLI:

```sh
> cargo install veloxide
```

To create your own app:

```zsh
> veloxide init my-app

# Go to created folder
> cd my-app

# Install tools
> make tools.required

# Start the supporting containers, followed by the build process
> make dev

# Once done, open `my-app/` in your IDE

# Happy Coding!
```

- The OpenAPI interactive documentation is available at `http://localhost:4005/swagger-ui/`
- GraphQL Playground is available at `http://localhost:9000/`

## Why the name?

Velox + Oxide = Veloxide

- Velox: latin for "swift", "rapid" or "quick", just like development with this stack 😉
- Oxide: Rust is an iron oxide, and all components of Veloxide are written in Rust.
